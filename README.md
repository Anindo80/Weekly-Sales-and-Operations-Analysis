## Executive Summary:
Using Excel, SQL, and Tableau, I analyzed operational data to analyze sales performance, revenue, profitability, inventory usage, and staffing for a coffee shop over a six-day period. An interactive dashboard was developed to present Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) including total cost, total revenue, net profit, customer buying preference (dine in vs. take-out) and visualized data identifying top-selling products, peak sales hours, staffing schedules, and ingredient consumptions. The dashboard enables data-driven decision-making by uncovering actionable insights for cost management and revenue and profit opportunities.

## Project Objective:
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) to:
-	Evaluate sales performance across product types, sizes, and time periods
-	Optimize staff scheduling by examining employee hours, shifts, and labor cost
-	Monitor inventory levels by tracking ingredient usage, stock levels, and restocking needs

---

## Methodology:
-	Explored datasets to understand the structure and key data fields required for analysis
-	Performed data cleaning in Excel by formatting data types, removing duplicates & irrelevant fields, creating calculated columns, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency & accuracy 
-	Extracted cleaned data from multiple datasets and prepared them for analysis by writing SQL queries 
-	Analyzed data in tableau using data aggregation functions and calculated fields to compute sales, cost, revenue, profit, customer preference, staffing schedule, and inventory levels
-	Delivered a final interactive dashboard to visualize key KPIs and findings

## Results & Key Findings:
-	Generated a net profit of £770 after accounting for £1,857 in total revenue and £1087 in total costs for the 6-day period
-	Cold and White Mochas were the top selling products, contributing nearly 20% of total sales and generating the highest individual revenue and profit
-	Customer preference of dine-in vs. take-out was nearly balanced 
-	Afternoon sales were 84 units lower than morning, resulting into a 26.84% decrease 
-	Total cold drink sales were 34.66% lower than hot drink sales
-	Identified weekly ingredient usage trends to predict restocking needs and cost optimization

---

## Recommendations & Next Steps:
-	Implement marketing strategies to increase sales of cold drinks products
-	Introduce promotional hours during slower afternoon hours
-	Re-evaluate staff schedule to adjust hours during slow afternoon hours to decrease current weekly labor cost of £840
-	Develop an automated inventory tracking and management system to prevent stockouts
